# Gala Store Data Visualization with Power BI

This repository contains my work on data visualization using Power BI as part of an Artificial Intelligence Job Simulation provided by Cognizant. The primary objective of this project was to learn and apply data visualization techniques on a real-world dataset.

# Project Overview

Dataset: Gala Store dataset, provided during the Cognizant AI Job Simulation.

Objective: To perform data preprocessing, build models, and create insightful visualizations using Power BI.

Tools Used:
Data Preprocessing: Python (for cleaning and preparing the data)

Model Building: Machine Learning models to extract patterns and predictions

Data Visualization: Power BI, to create interactive and comprehensive visual reports.
# Visualizations
The visualizations created in Power BI focus on key metrics such as sales performance, customer demographics, product analysis, and other relevant business insights derived from the dataset.

# Conclusion
This project was a learning experience in data visualization with Power BI, enhancing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and dashboard creation. The insights gained through this simulation have strengthened my ability to turn raw data into meaningful business intelligence.
